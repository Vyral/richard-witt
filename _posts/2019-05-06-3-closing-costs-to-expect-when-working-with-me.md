Sellers often ask me to explain how their closing costs will differ when working with me compared to if they were to pursue a traditional listing experience. Simply put, those who sell to me outright can generally expect lower closing costs than if they listed on the open market.

When you work with an agent to sell your home on the open market, your closing costs will include broker fees, financing fees, and other relevant costs.&nbsp;

There are only three definite closing costs sellers who work with me are subject to. **The first is the transfer tax**—something that’s required by the state of New York. This tax amounts to $4 for every $1,000 of the purchase price. So if I were to buy a home for $500,000, the transfer tax would be approximately $2,000.&nbsp;

**The second closing cost those who sell to me must pay is the legal fees.** Real estate attorneys are required to oversee transactions in our state and will charge between $750 to $2,000, depending on the level of service they provide.

**Finally, there’s the matter of property taxes.** This is something all sellers must account for regardless of what avenue they choose when selling their property.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or are curious what the closing costs might look like for your specific transaction, feel free to give me a call, send me an email, or visit www.nyccashhomebuyer.com.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.
